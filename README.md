🔍 Analyze HTTP and DNS requests and create custom DNS records for your subdomain.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Quick-start using git and docker compose:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adrgs/requestrepo.git
cd requestrepo
cp .env.example .env # modify .env as needed
docker compose up --build
```

⚠️ **Don't forget to edit .env**

This will setup a production-ready environment with the following services:
 - 🌐 HTTP/S server on ports 80 and 443
 - 🔌 DNS server on port 53

In order for DNS logging to work, the public IP of the DNS service must be set up as the authoritative nameserver for the domain. Do this by creating any named `A` record pointing to your domain first. Then point an `NS` record with the name where you want to host requestrepo and as a value, the previously created `A` record's name.

Below both situations for `example.com` or `rr.example.com` are explained depending on what you want to set up.

### 🔧 Setup for root domain

This is how https://requestrepo.com is set up, and you can set up if you want to dedicate 100% of your domain to this application. Generated subdomains will be under `*.example.com`.

Using `@` to mean the root domain, the following should be your DNS configuration:

| Record Type | Name  |             Value |
| ----------- | ----- | ----------------: |
| NS          | `@`   | `ns1.example.com` |
| A           | `ns1` |     `<PUBLIC_IP>` |

An HTTPS certificate should automatically be generated by requestrepo if you configured the `.env` file correctly.

### ⚙️ Setup for subdomain

If you instead already have other web applications running on your domain, and want to only serve requestrepo on a subdomain (eg. `rr.example.com`), follow this explanation.

| Record Type | Name  |             Value |
| ----------- | ----- | ----------------: |
| NS          | `rr`  | `ns1.example.com` |
| A           | `ns1` |     `<PUBLIC_IP>` |

You can use a reverse proxy like [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) to map to different internal ports based on the hostname. Configure the port `80:80` inside [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to be some other unused port, optionally listen on just the 127.0.0.1 address. Like:

```yml
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:8000:80
```

Then configure your reverse proxy to pass requests matching your subdomain to your chosen port. Make sure the following two settings are taken care of:

1. The `Host:` header must be kept for requestrepo to extract the random part of the subdomain.
2. The paths `/api/ws` and `/api/ws2` need to have WebSocket support through the `Upgrade:` and `Connection:` headers

Below is an example implementation for Nginx:

```conf
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name rr.example.com *.rr.example.com;  # Your subdomain hosting requestrepo

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;  # Forward the Host: header
        }
        # Enable websockets for /api/ws and /api/ws2
        location ~ ^/api/ws2?$ {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }
}
```

To enable HTTPS, you don't need to let requestrepo generate a certificate. Instead do so on the reverse proxy side and internally always forward to HTTP. Use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to easily get a free wildcard certificate:

```bash
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns \
  -d rr.example.com \
  -d "*.rr.example.com"
```

Then configure your reverse proxy to use the certificate on port 443, in Nginx, for example:

```conf
listen 443 ssl;
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/rr.example.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/rr.example.com/privkey.pem;
```

### 🌍 Enabling ip2country feature

To enable the ip2country feature, you need to download the free IP to Country Lite database from [db-ip](https://db-ip.com/db/download/ip-to-country-lite).

The csv file must be placed in `ip2country/vendor/dbip-country-lite.csv.gz`

## 💻 Development

For development, it is recommended to use the Makefile to start the services for the best developer experience.

### 🚀 Starting the Services

```sh
# Start the backend service
make start-backend

# Start the frontend service
make start-frontend
```

### 🔌 Starting the DNS Server

The DNS server needs to be started manually:

```sh
# Start the DNS server
cd dns; python ns.py
```
